# react-d3-charts
d3 charts as ReactJS components.

Although there have been [several](http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/) [different](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/d22bbf92231876505e5d) approaches proposed for combining the power of d3 with the flexibility and modularity of ReactJS, the approach I'm using here was inspired by [this blog post](http://10consulting.com/2014/02/19/d3-plus-reactjs-for-charting/) by Ben Smith of [Binary Consulting](http://10consulting.com/).

## Todo
* Many more charts types!
