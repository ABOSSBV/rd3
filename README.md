## react-d3
Modular ReactJS charts calculated with the help of d3.

**Caution:**  alpha quality software.

### Chart types
Current charts:
* bar chart
* line chart
* pie chart

### Background
Although there have been [several](http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/) [different](http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/d22bbf92231876505e5d) approaches proposed for combining the power of d3 with the flexibility and modularity of ReactJS, the approach I'm using here was inspired by [this blog post](http://10consulting.com/2014/02/19/d3-plus-reactjs-for-charting/) by Ben Smith of [Binary Consulting](http://10consulting.com/).

### Todo
* Many more charts types!
